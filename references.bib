abstract = {Abstract In this paper we describe an Incomplete LU factorization technique based on a strategy which combines two heuristics. This ILUT factorization extends the usual ILU(O) factorization without using the concept of level of fill-in. There are two traditional ways of developing incomplete factorization preconditioners. The first uses a symbolic factorization approach in which a level of fill is attributed to each fill-in element using only the graph of the matrix. Then each fill-in that is introduced is dropped whenever its level of fill exceeds a certain threshold. The second class of methods consists of techniques derived from modifications of a given direct solver by including a dropoff rule, based on the numerical size of the fill-ins introduced, traditionally referred to as threshold preconditioners. The first type of approach may not be reliable for indefinite problems, since it does not consider numerical values. The second is often far more expensive than the standard ILU(O). The strategy we propose is a compromise between these two extremes.},

abstract = {2-butanone (methyl ethyl ketone) is a recently identified high-octane, next-generation biofuel candidate, synthesized through microbiological pathways from biomass. Its high octane number (RON = 117), low boiling point (80°C), and relatively high vapor pressure (10.8kPa at 20°C) make 2-butanone a potentially good candidate for use in spark-ignition engines. The flame structure and species formed in 2-butanone combustion are of interest when further considering this compound for use as a fuel. To this end, the present study has, for the first time, quantitatively measured species profiles within a fuel-rich (ϕ = 1.6) laminar premixed flat flame of 2-butanone. Two experiments which used different facilities and measurement techniques were combined to provide a cross comparison of the measured species. One experiment was performed using electron ionization (EI) molecular-beam mass spectrometry (MBMS), and the second relied on synchrotron-generated vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization (PI) MBMS. Quantitative mole fraction profiles for about 45 species were obtained from the two independent experiments that are found to be in good agreement. The experiments have identified the formation of a number of toxic oxygenated intermediates, such as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde. In addition, the measurements have also provided quantitative species profiles for a number of soot precursor species, the concentrations of which are notably low. These measurements provide useful validation targets for the further development of detailed chemical kinetic models. As a first test, an existing 2-butanone model was examined against the experimental data with the main aim to identify elements of the model that may need improvement.}

abstract = {Butenes are intermediates ubiquitously formed by decomposition and oxidation of larger hydrocarbons (e.g. alkanes) or alcohols present in conventional or reformulated fuels. In this study, a series of novel ignition delay time (IDT) experiments of trans-2-butene were performed in a high-pressure shock tube (HPST) and in a rapid compression machine (RCM) under conditions of relevance to practical combustors. This is the first IDT data of trans-2-butene taken at engine relevant conditions, and the combination of HPST and RCM results greatly expands the range of data available for the oxidation of trans-2-butene to higher pressures (10–50atm), lower temperatures (670–1350K) and a wide range of equivalence ratios (0.5–2.0). A comprehensive chemical kinetic mechanism has simultaneously been developed to describe the combustion of trans-2-butene. It has been validated using the IDT data measured here in addition to a large variety of literature data: jet-stirred reactor (JSR) speciation data, premixed flame speciation data, flow reactor speciation data and laminar flame speed data. Moreover, the reactivity of trans-2-butene is compared to that of the other two isomers, 1-butene and isobutene, and these comparisons are discussed. Important reactions are highlighted via flux and sensitivity analyses and help explain the differences in reactivity among the butene isomers.}

abstract = {We present a model of the lithium–sulfur (Li/S) battery based on a multi-step, elementary sulfur reduction mechanism including dissolved polysulfide anions. The model includes a description of the evolution of solid phases in the carbon/sulfur composite cathode as well as multi-component (Li+, PF6–, S8, S82–, S62–, S42–, S22–, S2–) mass and charge transport in the liquid electrolyte. The chemical reaction mechanism consists of a Li/Li+ oxidation reaction at the anode and a six-step polysulfide reduction mechanism at the cathode. The modeling framework allows for the simulation of charge and discharge profiles as well as electrochemical impedance spectra. The latter are obtained via a voltage step/current relaxation technique based on the physicochemical model without the need for applying equivalent circuit models. The results indicate that the discharge behavior of this Li/S cell is governed by the presence of solid reactant and product phases in exchange with the dissolved polysulfide anions. The first and last stages of the discharge are characterized by the presence of solid S8 and Li2S, respectively, while the intermediate stage corresponds to a situation where all chemical compounds are dissolved in the electrolyte.}

abstract = {This paper sketches the main research developments in the area of iterative methods for solving linear systems during the 20th century. Although iterative methods for solving linear systems find their origin in the early 19th century (work by Gauss), the field has seen an explosion of activity spurred by demand due to extraordinary technological advances in engineering and sciences. The past five decades have been particularly rich in new developments, ending with the availability of large toolbox of specialized algorithms for solving the very large problems which arise in scientific and industrial computational models. As in any other scientific area, research in iterative methods has been a journey characterized by a chain of contributions building on each other. It is the aim of this paper not only to sketch the most significant of these contributions during the past century, but also to relate them to one another.}

abstract = {In 2014, NASA released a report outlining a future state for aerospace computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the CFD Vision 2030 Study (the Study).1 Developed by experts from industry, government, and academia, the Study provided a forecast of CFD capabilities required for turbulent, transitional, and reacting flow simulations across a broad Mach number regime. In addition, the Study provided an aspirational role for future CFD as part of a routine, efficient, and physics-based aerospace design and development process. This future role of CFD was summarized in the Study as follows: “A single engineer/scientist must be able to conceive, create, analyze, and interpret a large ensemble of related simulations in a time-critical period (e.g., 24 hours), without individually managing each simulation, to a prespecified level of accuracy.”},
